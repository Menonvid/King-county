## Results from our Model:

The  R-squared value for our Model is 0.73; our model explains 73% of the variance.
Main Factors that caused an increase in house price:
The no. of bathrooms, sqft_living, grade, zipcode
Location has a high impact on house price:
Top 3 zip codes with a high price factor: 98039, 98004, 98040

Predicting house prices is quite complex and challenging because they depend on various factors such as Sqft living, No. of bathrooms, Grade of a house and Zipcode. The other factors that influence the price of a house are Distance to workplace, Renovation and Waterfront features.

While Modelling, we see that the Grade of a house, Zipcode and Bathrooms have large positive coefficients which indicate the effect they have on the pricing of a house.

In Model 4, we have divided our data into continuous and categorical data. We then took a log of our continuous variables and then normalized it. We categorized our categorical data and added them into a data frame. We then run our OLS model and remove variables which have p>0.05. We again run our OLS model and get R2 score of 0.737. When checking for Normality, the QQ plot looks good too. The Homoscedasticity graph looks quite appropriate. We also checked for Multicollinearity, and see that the vif values were all under 5. Hence we will go with the Model 4.


## Conclusion
The average cost of a house in King County is about $540,297.  

Renovated houses seems to have higher price than non-renovated.  

Sqft area of a house, number of bathrooms, Grade and zipcode are important features while considering selling of a house.  

A house with waterfront feature also has higher price for a house.  

## Limitations & Further Research
During the EDA, we came across lot of outliers in terms of prices and other features. We would like to investigate that data. Also, segment the houses into luxury houses and ordinary houses. Also take into consideration the amenities and the neighborhood of the locality that surely increase the price of a house.
